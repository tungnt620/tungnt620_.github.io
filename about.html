                    <h2>About WWOOF</h2>
                    <p class="text-introduction">Originally called “Working Weekends on Organic Farms”, WWOOF came into being in England, in Autumn 1971, when Sue Coppard,
                        a secretary living and working in London, recognised the need for people like herself, who did not have the means
                        or the opportunity, to access the countryside and support the organic movement.</p>
                    <p>Her idea started with a trial working weekend for four people at a bio dynamic farm at Emerson College in Sussex, arranged
                        through a contact in the Soil Association. The weekend was a great success and things gathered momentum very quickly.
                        Soon many more organic farmers and smallholders were willing to host people keen to work on their farms in return
                        for food and accommodation (WWOOFers). Hosts and WWOOFers made new friends and enjoyed the experience of exchanging
                        assistance and knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 24px; line-height: 1;">Where it all started</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>WWOOF UK developed quickly with the organisation adapting its systems to meet the needs of WWOOFers and hosts. It remains
                        flexible and adaptable and continues to benefit greatly from enthusiastic grassroots input and feedback. Offers of
                        help from members are actively encouraged. All suggestions are aired and discussed and many implemented. WWOOF's
                        ethos is one of evolution and constant improvement. Now there are autonomous WWOOF organisations in many countries;
                        all of whom have their own ways of organising themselves. However they all have similar aims. Hosts in countries
                        without a national group are listed by WWOOF Independents.
                    </p>
                    <h3>A maturing organization</h3>
                    <p>In the year 2000 the first International WWOOF conference was held with representatives from 15 countries.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>It was agreed to:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Develop guidelines as to what is meant by being a WWOOFer, a WWOOF host and to go WWOOFing.&nbsp;</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Encourage and support emerging WWOOF organisations in developing countries.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>The present</h3>
                    <p>In the last few years many new WWOOF organisations have been created with the help and support of existing WWOOF groups
                        so that in 2012 there are more than 50 WWOOF groups world wide.
                    </p>
                    <p>When the demand for longer periods on farms occurred, the name waschanged from "Working Weekends on Organic Farms" to
                        "Willing Workers On Organic Farms". However the use of the word “work” in the title caused problems in some regions
                        as the organisation became inappropriately connected with migrant work and viewed as a clandestine migrant worker
                        organisation.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a result of this – and in recognition of the world wide nature of the organisation we have become "World Wide Opportunities
                        On Organic Farms". This change of name was accepted at the meeting in the year 2000, though some WWOOF groups still
                        prefer to use old versions of the name. By sharing the experience of countries that have successfully negotiated
                        national recognition of WWOOF as a bone fide cultural exchange and learning experience it is hoped that national
                        organisations still having problems with their immigration authorities will be able to influence change.
                    </p>
                    <p>The advantages of acting together on the world stage have become more and more important for WWOOF groups over the years
                        and at another international meeting in Korea in 2011 it was agreed that a Federation of WWOOF Organisations (FoWO)
                        should be formed.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>The federation's establishment involved more than 18 months of discussion and negotiation between parties within the
                        WWOOF movement from across the world and was finally incorporated in March 2013 (<a href="http://www.wwoof.net/">www.wwoof.net</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>As well as the various practical functions performed by the FoWO, such as addressing trademarking issues, helping to
                        legalize and protect the WWOOF movement, some of the main objects of this umbrella organisation are to support and
                        promote the various existing national organisations by providing these with a previously non-existent coordinative
                        network. Member countries are now regularly communicating between each other and sharing precious knowledge and informations
                        for the development of this steadily growing movement.
                    </p>
                    <p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #e5e9de;">WWOOF is now recognised as having an important contribution to make in the wider organic world as it brings more and more people into direct contact with organic growers both independently and through other organisations who are trying to influence policy and consumer demand. Through its newsletters WWOOF organisations inform their members of organic news, views, jobs and training.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="ssfe-adjust-padding-bottom">WWOOF is still growing and 'to wwoof' has entered languages in its own right. WWOOFers have given 1000's of hours of
                        help to organic growers and WWOOF hosts have given their time and experience to WWOOFers and opened the door to a
                        way of living that continues to fundamentally change people's lives.</p>
